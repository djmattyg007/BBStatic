BBStatic

BBStatic is a static site generator written in PHP that uses BBCode for content
and Handlebars templates for rendering full pages.

This is still very much a work in progress. Currently, it will render
standalone pages, individual blog posts, and a blog index list page. It
doesn't generate anything like sitemaps and such, but it is getting there.
I'd definitely appreciate any help or advice anyone can offer!
