BBStatic

BBStatic is a static site generator written in PHP that uses BBCode for content
and Mustache templates for rendering full pages.

This is still very much a work in progress. Currently, it will render
standalone pages, and individual blog posts. It won't generate blog list pages,
nor anything such as a sitemap. Things are changing frequently, but I'd
definitely appreciate any help or advice anyone can offer!
